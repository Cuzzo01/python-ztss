## STAGE 0: POPULATE THE LIST

Everyone adds a pair of random numbers, shuffles the list, and passes it on.

## STAGE 1: DO THE SHUNT

P1 shuffles the list and then shunts the pairs along one space to form new pairs (last number wraps to first number).

Everyone from P2 to Pn-1 uses a 50% probability of also shunting an extra space in the same direction. Pn definitely does not shunt.

No one shuffles. Everyone replaces their random numbers.

## STAGE 2: THE CHECK

Everyone looks to see where their numbers are and remembers their exact location. If they move at any point from now on, a player should raise the alarm that the system has been compromised.

No one shuffles. Everyone replaces their random numbers.

## STAGE 3: THE BIG REVEAL

Everyone replaces their 'left numbers' (aka 'receiver IDs') with their name of any other agreed system for identifying people. The other number is replaced with a new random number, no one shuffles.

## STAGE 4: THE READ OUT

Goes around the loop again with everyone looking to see whose name their random number is paired with. This is who they buy a gift for. They then cover their tracks by swapping out the random number for a new one.
